An Innovative Project for AI-Supported Log Analysis and Chatbot Interaction
**An Innovative Project for AI-Supported Log Analysis and Chatbot Interaction**

This project combines modern technologies such as Electron, Flask, WebSockets, and various AI models to provide efficient log analysis and an interactive chatbot interface. The system can analyze error logs, manage log files, and interact with different AI models to support debugging processes.

---

### **Project Overview**

The project consists of several components:

- **Frontend** (Electron-based) for user interaction
- **Backend** (Flask server) for log data processing
- **AI Models** for analyzing and interpreting error logs
- **WebSocket Communication** for real-time interaction
- **Import/Export Functions** for configuration settings
- **A Twitch Bot** for integration with streaming platforms

---

### **Features in Detail**

#### **1. Log Analysis and Debugging**
The system enables the analysis of error logs using various AI models. The backend, written in Python with Flask, receives log entries and processes them with the following AI services:

- **OpenAI's GPT-4** for semantic analysis
- **LLaMA (local model)** for offline processing
- **Google Gemini API** for alternative AI-based analysis

The backend can simplify, interpret, and provide debugging recommendations for logs.

#### **2. Electron Frontend and User Interface**
The user interface was developed with **Electron** and allows:
- Selection of AI models to use
- Display of debugging analyses
- Log display and storage
- Configuration of AI API keys
- Application settings

#### **3. WebSocket Communication**
The project uses **WebSockets** to enable bidirectional real-time communication with an external server instance. This architecture facilitates integration with AI models that use external WebSocket interfaces.

#### **4. Import/Export of Settings**
With a dedicated **Settings Module**, users can export and later import their configurations. This allows:
- Storage of API keys
- Enabling or disabling AI functions
- Adjusting computation modes (CPU/GPU)

#### **5. Twitch Integration**
A custom **Twitch bot** can respond to messages in the stream and execute predefined commands. This expands the interaction possibilities for streamers who want to use AI-powered chats or log analysis.
